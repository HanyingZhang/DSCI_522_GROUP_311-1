# DSCI_522_GROUP_311 Milestone Wine Quality Prediction
-------------
**Author**: Hanying Zhang, Tao Huang, Xugang Zhong

The milestone project is for the course DSCI522 Data Science Workflows from Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. This repository includes data, scripts and other analysis-related files. The project predicts the wine quality based on data obtained from the [University of California Irvine Machine learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). 


## Introduction

According to [British Columbia Wine Institute](https://winebc.com/industry/media/quick-facts/), the BC wine industry contributes approximately $2.8 billion annually to British Columbia’s economy. To facilitate the development of BC wine industry, stakeholders are seeking a better way to improve the wine production and selling process with new techniques applied. Globally, wine certification and quality assessment are essential given this context. 

Wine quality assessment basically consists of two parts: lab test and sensory test. Physicochemical lab test generally characterize wine based on features such as density, pH value, acidity, sugar, and alcohol, etc. While the sensory test is mainly relying on qualified expert. Due to the low interpretation of human sense, the relationship between sensory test and the lab test is somehow compared to a black box. Therefore, the industry is curious about how ‘good’ the wine is, given the physicochemical lab test results.
