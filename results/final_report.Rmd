## Summary



## Introduction

According to [British Columbia Wine Institute]( https://winebc.com/industry/media/quick-facts/), the BC wine industry contributes approximately $2.8 billion annually to British Columbia’s economy. To facilitate the development of BC wine industry, stakeholders are seeking a better way to improve the wine production and selling process with new techniques applied. Globally, wine certification and quality assessment are essential given this context.

Wine quality assessment basically consists of two parts: the lab test and the sensory test. Physicochemical lab tests generally characterize wine based on features such as density, pH value, acidity, sugar, and alcohol, etc. While the sensory test is mainly relying on qualified experts. Due to the low interpretation of human sense, the relationship between sensory tests and the lab tests is somehow compared to a black box. The industry is curious about how ‘good’ the wine is, given the physicochemical lab test results.  Therefore, a model integrating physiochemical lab tests and sensory tests is helpful in addressing the industry concern, supporting the wine evaluation and thus improving local wine production.
